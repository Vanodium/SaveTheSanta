# SaveTheSanta Game![santa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba3cd0a1-1718-468f-959e-db1ee6107cd3)

This is my "Doodle Jump" inspired platformer implemented using Python Pygame: Santa needs to get to the top to touch the coin without falling on the way. All the sounds and textures are made from scratch by me
